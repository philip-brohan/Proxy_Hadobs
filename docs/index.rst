Faster Monitoring Datasets
==========================

In the Met Office, we have a very powerful and sophisticated operational suite which produces accurate and precise estimates of today’s weather, and good, if imperfect, forecasts of weather up to 5 days ahead. We also have much more uncertain monthly, seasonal, annual, and decadal forecasts, for further ahead. 

We don’t use this operational system for climate monitoring. Instead, we collect our own observations and process them independently. This produces stable, well-understood, reliable datasets; but the process is expensive (in scientist time), lags real-time by several weeks, and is less accurate and precise than it could be (we use relatively few observations and very simple covariance models). 

The aim of this project is to use operational (analysis and forecast) data to produce climate monitoring datasets in real time (or even sooner).
